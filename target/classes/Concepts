Coroutines,  run on a shared pool of threads by default, and the same thread can run many coroutines.
As fewer threads are used, this makes it more efficient to use coroutines when you want to run tasks asynchronously.

same thread can run different co-routines and hence its much more efficient than running threads.

run blocking runs coroutines on the same thread.
